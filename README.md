The Amazon Sales Data Analysis project aims to gain deep insights into the sales data of three branches located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. Through thorough analysis, this project seeks to understand various factors influencing sales performance across different branches. The dataset comprises 1000 rows and 17 columns, encompassing crucial information such as invoice details, branch location, customer demographics, product information, sales figures, and ratings.
Approach Used:

Data Wrangling: Inspect and preprocess the data, handling missing values and performing necessary data replacements.

Feature Engineering: Generated new columns to extract insights such as time of day, day of the week, and month of the year for each transaction.
